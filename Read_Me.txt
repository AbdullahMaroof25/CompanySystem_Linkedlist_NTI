Thanks for          : ENG: Mohamed Taha , it was great honour to me to attend this track with him 
                                          and gain much information from him. 
                                  

The CMD command line to compile The project :

 gcc main.c   System_Program.c GUI.c -o program.exe

-> There is already compiled file its name is : program.exe

so u can just write in cmd ->: program.exe  

Note :

The program may be not Perfect and there are other better alghorithms 
and way to write the code . But I just try to apply many ways and designes
so that was my final product.
